Sort the remaining employees in descending order of their years of experience, and then by their performance ratings in ascending order.
Return a new list containing the names of the remaining employee3s, but with each name reversed and in uppercase.

Task 2:
Create a program that takes a list of Employee objects as input and performs the following operations:
Filter out all employees who have joined in the last 5 years and have a performance rating of less than 8, but have a salary between 60,000 and 120,000.
Sort the remaining employees in ascending order of their salaries, and then by their years of experience in descending order.
Return a new list containing the IDs of the remaining employee3s, but with each ID multiplied by 10.

Task 3:
Write a program that reads a list of Employee objects from the user and performs the following operations:
Remove all employees who are part-time and have a salary less than 50,000, but are in the Sales or Marketing department.
Calculate the sum of the salaries of the remaining employees, but only for those who have more than 3 years of experience.

    private int age;
    private int yearsOfEnrollment;
    private double gpa;
    private int numberOfIncompleteCourses;
    .........
}

Task 1:
Write a program that takes a set of Student objects as input and performs the following operations:
Group the students by their major into a Map where the key is the major and the value is a set of students in that major, but only for majors with more than 5 students and an average GPA above 3.0.
Sort the students within each major in ascending order of their GPA, and then by their age in descending order.
Return the Map containing the grouped and sorted students.

Task 2:
Implement a program that reads a set of Student objects from the user and performs the following operations:
Filter out all students who have a GPA less than the average GPA of all students, but have an age above 18 and a major in Biology or Chemistry.
Calculate the total years of enrollment of the remaining students, but only for those who have joined in the last 4 years and are majoring in Computer Science or Engineering.
Find the student with the highest years of enrollment and return their details, but only if they have an age below 30 and a GPA above 3.7.

Task 3:
Create a program that takes a set of Student objects as input and performs the following operations:
Filter out all students who have joined in the last 3 years and have a major in Mathematics, but have a GPA below 3.0 and are on academic probation.
Calculate the sum of the GPAs of the remaining students, but only for those who have an age above 22 and a GPA above the average GPA.
Find the average age of the remaining students, but only if their department has more than 10 students and an average GPA above 3.5.
Calculate the factorial of the average age, but only if the total years of enrollment of all students is greater than 30 and the average GPA is below 3.9.
